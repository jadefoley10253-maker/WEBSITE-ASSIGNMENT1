        <p>My name is Jade Foley. I am a 25 year old college student that is currently studying game design & development.
        Previously, I was studying Motion Graphics, Visual Effects and Animation, however the second year did not go ahead
        and i decided to jump straight into second year of game design instead. I currently work as a massage therapist and 
        I have amassed over 95k followers across platforms such as Tiktok, Youtube and Instagram.
